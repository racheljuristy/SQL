#In this project, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data using PostgreSQL syntax.  

--How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT count(*) 
FROM  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';


-- When was the most recent batch of TV shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";


--List all movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;


--Who was the director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT

FROM 
"CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people 
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
where titles.title='Bright Star';

--What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
