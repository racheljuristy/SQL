#In this project, I'm querying a database containing multiple dables with information related to monthly customer orders and customer data.  
#The queries performed are to quantify statistics about customers and order data, and were executed in SQLite Studio RDBMS.  

-- #1 How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT (orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND OrderID <> 'Order ID';


-- #2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';


-- #3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in February 
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM customers 
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND OrderID <> 'Order ID';


-- #4 Which Product was the cheapest one sold in Jan, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product
FROM JanSales
WHERE price in 
(SELECT min(price) 
FROM BIT_db.JanSales);


-- #5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in Jan? (use the number of products sold and price of products) 
SELECT SUM(JanSales.Quantity)* JanSales.price as rev, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


-- #6 Which products were sold in Feb at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 
SELECT 
SUM (Quantity),
SUM (FebSales.Quantity) * FebSales.price as rev,
Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;


-- #7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2 
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


-- #8 List all products sold in Los Angeles in February and include how many of each were sold.  
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product


--#9 Which locations in New York recieved at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 
SELECT location, COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
WHERE location like "%NY%" 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location 
HAVING count(orderID)>2;

--#10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February? 
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
WHERE product LIKE "%Headphone%"

--#11 What was the average amount spent per account in February? 
SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id 

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--#12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
SELECT count(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id 

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--#13 Which product brought in the most revenue in Jan and how much revenue did it bring in total? 
SELECT Product, 
sum(Quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product
